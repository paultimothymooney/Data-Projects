Typically, in a *bottom-up* approach, you first learn all the separate components you will be using, and then you gradually build them up into more complex structures.  The problems with this are that students often lose motivation, don't have a sense of the \"big picture\", and don't know what they'll need.\n\nIf you took the fast.ai deep learning course, that is what we used.

Rather, they start playing with a just general sense of it, and then gradually learn more rules/details as time goes on.\n\nAll that to say, don't worry if you don't understand everything at first!

Well, perhaps not...\n\nPossibly **the most important idea** in machine learning is that of having separate training & validation data sets. As motivation, suppose you don't divide up your data, but instead use all of it.  And suppose you have lots of parameters:\n\n<img src=\"images/overfitting2.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 70%\"/>\n<center>\n[Underfitting and Overfitting](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/361/when-is-a-model-underfitted)\n</center>\n\nThe error for the pictured data points is lowest for the model on the far right (the blue curve passes through the red points almost perfectly), yet it's not the best choice.  Why is that?  If you were to gather some new data points, they most likely would not be on that curve in the graph on the right, but would be closer to the curve in the middle graph.\n\nThis illustrates how using all our data can lead to **overfitting**. A validation set helps diagnose this problem."},{"metadata":{"hidden":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"8dce4810131eae5bdcecdb5a4b1f6c2a8aba0cbb"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def split_vals(a,n): return a[:n].copy(), a[n:].copy()\n\nn_valid = 12000  # same as Kaggle's test set size\nn_trn = len(df)-n_valid\nraw_train, raw_valid = split_vals(df_raw, n_trn)\nX_train, X_valid = split_vals(df, n_trn)\ny_train, y_valid = split_vals(y, n_trn)\n\nX_train.shape, y_train.shape, X_valid.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9c09fd9175ded77a5ee7bdf5e77ea5442bd10d1f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Random Forests"},{"metadata":{"heading_collapsed":true,"_uuid":"2639f8c0f660b71de353c3f01f3a67f44e6420ac"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Base model"},{"metadata":{"hidden":true,"_uuid":"4a5ca0ebcd1bb6b2d9f4d88c04d5e909fa1800ca"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's try our model again, this time with separate training and validation sets."},{"metadata":{"hidden":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"36f5515723b5a3bdcc16db4d524f83cc1ec6ade8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def rmse(x,y): return math.sqrt(((x-y)**2).mean())\n\ndef print_score(m):\n    res = [rmse(m.predict(X_train), y_train), rmse(m.predict(X_valid), y_valid),\n                m.score(X_train, y_train), m.score(X_valid, y_valid)]\n    if hasattr(m, 'oob_score_'): res.append(m.oob_score_)\n    print(res)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"hidden":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"bdaba637bd8cc22889bbbfbc93f682de21fbbda8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"m = RandomForestRegressor(n_jobs=-1)\n%time m.fit(X_train, y_train)\nprint_score(m)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"hidden":true,"_uuid":"faaf3ca8fe7e6ba9b2ae0a583221fd19f5632a4c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"An r^2 in the high-80's isn't bad at all (and the RMSLE puts us around rank 100 of 470 on the Kaggle leaderboard), but we can see from the validation set score that we're over-fitting badly.
