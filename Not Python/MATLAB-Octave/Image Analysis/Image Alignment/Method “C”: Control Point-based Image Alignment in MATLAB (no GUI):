# Method “C”: Control Point-based Image Alignment in MATLAB (no GUI):

donor = imread (‘D:\PTM\20160301 image analysis\donor.tif’)
rawfret = imread (‘D:\PTM\20160301 image analysis\rawfret.tif’)
donorscaled3408 = mat2gray (donor, [0, 3408])
rawfretscaled3093 = mat2gray (rawfret, [0, 3093])
cpselect (donorscaled3408, rawfretscaled3093)
next, zoom in and select common points then finish by going file=>export points to workspace
mytform = fitgeotrans (movingPoints, fixedPoints, ‘projective’)
registered = imwarp (donorscaled3408, mytform)
donorregistered = registered * 3408
imagesc (donorregistered)
