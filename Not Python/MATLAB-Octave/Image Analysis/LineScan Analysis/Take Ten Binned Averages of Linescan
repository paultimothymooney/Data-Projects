# This script can be used to convert continuous linescan data of any length into ten consecutive binned averages.
# An application of this script would be to determine the average fluroescence intensity for ten equally spaced regions across a structure of interest during fluorescence microscopy.

# First, import two columns (X,Y) of data into the MATLAB workspace.  
# The first column of x values should be named VarName1.  The second column of y values should be named VarName2.
# Run the following script in MATLAB:

topEdge = 1;
botEdge = 0;
numBins = 11;
binEdges = linspace(botEdge, topEdge, numBins+1);
[h, whichBin] = histc (VarName1, binEdges);
for i = 1:numBins
flagBinMembers = (whichBin == i);
binMembers = VarName2 (flagBinMembers);
binMean(i) = mean(binMembers);
end

# The output will be ten consecutive binned averages per each input of continuous linescan data.
