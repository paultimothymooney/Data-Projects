Modify the code to make improvements to the benchmark model. \n1. Submit your results to the InClass competition.  Were you able to improve the model?\n\nHint: \nThe easiest change to make would be to drop fewer features.  Another easy improvement would be to use a more sophisticated model such as [RandomForest](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) or [XGBoost](http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/).\n"
