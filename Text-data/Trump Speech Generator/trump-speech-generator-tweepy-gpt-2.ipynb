They call me on that and that, and that, all around being very, very respectful. Then I'm told the Democrats have called me on the issue of abortion, and I'm told that the Democrats have called me on the issue of the federal government.  That's all I know.  I'm told the Democrats call me on that.  They are going to call me on that because the Democrats are threatening to impeach me if I haven't done so. Well, I don't know what their plans are, but we have been called on all of those, and I am very confident that they will call me on them.  And then I'm told they are going to call me on my campaign for president.  That's all I know.  And they are going to call me on that and that, and that is all I know.  I'm told that I am going to do my job, and I'm not going to let anyone else tell me that. As a senator, I do not believe that anybody is going to tell me that. So, I think there is a very strong bipartisan support, because it's a bipartisan issue, but it's not partisan.  In fact, it's a very, very bipartisan issue.  And I think that's what this race is about.  It's about a lot of things, not just the Democrats, but the Republicans and the independents, who think that we need to get rid of the filibuster and to get rid of the death penalty, which is a very bad idea.  And they believe that we need to get rid of one of the three death penalty amendments, the death penalty, the death penalty, and that all of these things are dangerous to the Constitution.  And they are very strong in their support for keeping the death penalty out of the Constitution.  And they are going to tell me that their plan is to impeach me if I do so.  I'm told by the Democrats that they are going to call on me in the primary, and they are going to call on me in the general election, and they are going to call on me in the general election, and they are going to call on me in the general election and they are going to call on me in the general election. \r\n"
